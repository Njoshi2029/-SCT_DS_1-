# -SCT_DS_1-
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.  This task helps in understanding data visualization using Python (Matplotlib / Pandas).
Objective:
The goal of this task was to visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables, focusing specifically on Indiaâ€™s population trends. This included analyzing how age groups and genders are distributed across different time periods, and presenting those insights through meaningful visualizations.

ðŸ§  My Approach:

1. Data Analysis:

Collected and analyzed Indiaâ€™s population data spanning from 2000 to 2024.

Focused on identifying key demographic trends and transformations over time.



2. Exploring Relationships:

Population vs Gender â†’ to study the balance between male and female populations.

Population vs Age Group â†’ divided into categories:

0â€“14 years (young dependents)

15â€“64 years (working-age population)

65+ years (elderly dependents)




3. Data Visualization:

Used Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, etc.) to create clear and interactive visualizations.

Designed bar charts and distribution plots to effectively represent multi-category data.

Ensured the visuals clearly communicated the patterns and differences in population structure.




ðŸ“Š Outcome & Learnings:

Enhanced my ability to work with real-world datasets, clean and transform them into meaningful formats.

Learned how to apply data filtering techniques and create multi-dimensional visualizations.

Improved my skills in interpreting demographic data, uncovering trends in age distribution and gender balance across years.

This task helped me build a stronger foundation in data-driven storytelling, where numbers are not just analyzed but communicated effectively through visuals.


ðŸš€ Through this exercise, I strengthened my expertise in Python-based data analysis and learned how to make insights more accessible and understandable to diverse audiences.
